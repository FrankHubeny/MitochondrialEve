Various traditional beliefs hold that the Earth, or the entire universe, was brought into being in a grand creation event by one or more deities.

	abstract = {Young Earth creationism (YEC) is a form of creationism which holds as a central tenet that the Earth and its lifeforms were created by supernatural acts of the Abrahamic God between approximately 6,000 and 10,000 years ago. In its most widespread version, YEC is based on the religious belief in the inerrancy of certain literal interpretations of the Book of Genesis. Its primary adherents are Christians and Jews who believe that God created the Earth in six literal days. This is in contrast with old Earth creationism (OEC), which holds literal interpretations of Genesis that are compatible with the scientifically determined ages of the Earth and universe. It is also in contrast to theistic evolution, which posits that the scientific principles of evolution, the Big Bang, abiogenesis, solar nebular theory, age of the universe, and age of Earth are compatible with a metaphorical interpretation of the Genesis creation account.Since the mid-20th century, young Earth creationists—starting with Henry Morris (1918–2006)—have developed and promoted a pseudoscientific explanation called creation science as a basis for a religious belief in a supernatural, geologically recent creation, in response to the scientific acceptance of Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution, which was developed over the previous century. Contemporary YEC movements arose in protest to the scientific consensus, established by numerous scientific disciplines, which demonstrates that the age of the universe is around 13.8 billion years, the formation of the Earth and Solar System happened around 4.6 billion years ago, and the origin of life occurred roughly 4 billion years ago.A 2017 Gallup creationism survey found that 38 percent of adults in the United States held the view that "God created humans in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years" when asked for their views on the origin and development of human beings, which Gallup noted was the lowest level in 35 years. It was suggested that the level of support could be lower when poll results are adjusted after comparison with other polls with questions that more specifically account for uncertainty and ambivalence. Gallup found that, when asking a similar question in 2019, 40 percent of US adults held the view that "God created human beings pretty much in their present form at one time within the last 10,000 years or so".Among the biggest YEC organizations are Answers in Genesis, Institute for Creation Research, and Creation Ministries International.},

	abstract = {Most young-earth creationists who view the genealogies of Genesis 5 and 11 as yielding a continuous chronology from the creation of Adam to the birth of Abraham claim that the Hebrew Masoretic Text (MT) preserves the original begetting ages given to Moses by Yahweh. Calculations derived from the MT yield a timespan for this period of about 2008 years. The Greek Septuagint (LXX) yields a chronology for this era of 3394 years, 1386 years greater than the MT. In some LXX manuscripts of Genesis 5:25, Methuselah was 167 years old when he fathered Lamech, placing Methuselah’s death 14 years beyond the Deluge. This obvious problem often leads to a swift dismissal of any possibility that the LXX might preserve the original begetting ages and remaining years of life for each named patriarch in Genesis 5 and 11. This article will examine this issue and advance four main points: (1) the figure of 187 for Methuselah is original to the LXX translation and to Moses; (2) the reading of 167 in certain manuscripts of the LXX is a scribal error which occurred early in its complex transmissional history; (3) the appearance of 167 in some LXX manuscripts does not automatically negate the overall validity of the LXX’s primeval chronology; and (4) numerous lines of historical and textual evidence suggest the young-earth creation community should remain open and willing to contemplate the strong likelihood that the primeval chronology of the LXX reflects most of the numbers that Moses originally recorded in Genesis 5 and 11.},

	abstract = {With the recent increase in the available number of high-quality, full-length mitochondrial sequences, it is now possible to construct and analyze a comprehensive human mitochondrial consensus sequence. Using a data set of 827 carefully selected sequences, it is shown that modern humans contain extremely low levels of divergence from the mitochondrial consensus sequence, differing by a mere 21.6 nt sites on average. Fully 84.1\% of the mitochondrial genome was found to be invariant and ‘private’ mutations accounted for 43.8\% of the variable sites. Ninety eight percent of the variant sites had a primary nucleotide with an allele frequency of 0.90 or greater. Interestingly, the few truly ambiguous nucleotide sites could all be reliably assigned to either a purine or pyrimidine ancestral state. A comparison of this consensus sequence to several ancestral sequences derived from phylogenetic studies reveals a great deal of similarity, where, as expected, the most phylogenetically informative nucleotides in the ancestral studies tended to be the most variable nucleotides in the consensus. Allowing for this fact, the consensus approach provides variation data on the positions that do not contribute to phylogenetic reconstructions, and these data provide a baseline for measuring human mitochondrial variation in populations worldwide.},

	abstract = {The Cambridge Reference Sequence (CRS) for human mitochondrial DNA was first announced in 1981.A group led by Fred Sanger at the University of Cambridge had sequenced the mitochondrial genome of one woman of European descent during the 1970s, determining it to have a length of 16,569 base pairs (0.0006\% of the nuclear human genome) containing some 37 genes and published this sequence in 1981.When other researchers repeated the sequencing, some striking discrepancies were noted. The original published sequence included eleven errors, including one extra base pair in position 3107, and incorrect assignments of single base pairs.  Some of these were the result of contamination with bovine and HeLa specimens. The corrected revised CRS was published by Andrews et al. in 1999. (The original nucleotide numbering was retained to avoid confusion.) The reference sequence belongs to European haplogroup H2a2a1.  The revised CRS is designated as rCRS. It is deposited in the GenBank NCBI database under accession number NC\_012920.When mitochondrial DNA sequencing is used for genealogical purposes, the results are often reported as differences from the revised CRS. The CRS is a reference sequence rather than a record of the earliest human mtDNA. A difference between a tested sample and the CRS may have arisen in the lineage of the CRS or in the lineage of the tested sample. The CRS includes seven nucleotides that are rare polymorphisms: 263A, 311C-315C, 750A, 1438A, 4769A, 8860A, and 15326A.An alternative African (Yoruba) reference sequence has also been used sometimes instead of the Cambridge. It has a different numbering system with a length of 16,571 base pairs and represents the mitochondrial genome of one African individual. Other alternative reference sequences that have also sometimes been used include the African (Uganda), Swedish and Japanese sequences.In 2012, it was proposed that the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS), should be replaced by a new Reconstructed Sapiens Reference Sequence (RSRS). The RSRS keeps the same numbering system as the CRS, but represents the ancestral genome of Mitochondrial Eve, from which all currently known human mitochondria descend. The RSRS should be more useful for comparing the changes in different haplogroups although this has been debated. Family Tree DNA reports results for mtDNA for both rCRS and RSRS.},
